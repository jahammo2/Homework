This is the modal homework. Instructions are as follows:

Create a modal. For example:

https://dribbble.com/shots/1150089-Expiration-for?list=searches&tag=modal&offset=38

The content behind the modal should be darkened or greyed and not clickable

There should be a close icon or X somewhere on the modal
The content should be scrollable if it gets really long
